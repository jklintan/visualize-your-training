# Visualization of my training

A little visualization inspired by the Pulsar plot of the album cover of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_Pleasures">Unknown Pleasures</a> by <i>Joy Division</i>. Based on a simple ridgeline plot from d3.js. 

The data used is a csv-file containing training data that can be downloaded from <a href="https://connect.garmin.com/">Garmin Connect</a>. The height corresponds to the maximum elevation of the training, the position of the x-axis is based on the start time of the training and the width is based on the duration of the training. 

Working on expanding the visualization with some user-input to allow to create a visual compelling result of the trainings done during the past year.
